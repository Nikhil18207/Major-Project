# Memory Optimization Tips for RTX 4060:
# - Use batch_size: 4 with gradient_accumulation_steps: 8
# - Enable use_amp: true for mixed precision
# - Freeze encoder layers (freeze_layers: 2)
# - Reduce max_length to 256
# - Disable decoder KV cache during training
# - Use num_workers: 2 for data loading
